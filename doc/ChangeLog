1995/01/16	Version 0.4.0		On the net

	- Implemented CONFIG/UNCNFG more exactly.

	- Added support for different RAM or ROM cards.

	- Added G/GX support (lost of changes)
	  new colors, new labels, ...

	- Rewrote ROMDump for both S/SX and G/GX. Lots faster now.
	  Thanks go to Robert Tiismus <robert@Sneezy.net.ut.ee>

	- Corrected handling of Display and Menu images, fixed number
	  of lines in init_display(), to avoid XShmError on virgin
	  startup

	- Catch SIGPIPE and save state, so everything is saved, when
	  x48 gets terminated by xkill or the window manager


**********************************************************************

1994/12/07	Version 0.3.5		On the net

	- Serial and terminal lines now have the baudrate set
	  correctly.

	  . Watch out for the IR (serial) connection: speed is
            always set to 2400 Baud by the HP
	  . On the wire (terminal) connection speed is set to the
	    selected value

	- Removed stupid rounding in adjtime routine

	  . This caused missing of some part of a second when
	    adjusting the time on the HP

	- Suppress adjusting timer2 if this would cause an
	  increase of the timer, slow down the timer instead.

	  . Thanks go to Lutz Vieweg (he spotted this bug, while
            trying to use QED. (lkv@mania.robin.de)

	- Support for contrast control (ON_+, ON_-) added


	- Started command line parsing... (see below)

	Changes to the X11 Interface
	----------------------------

	- Implemented color-icon. Show state of HP48 in icon:

	  . if 'x48' is displayed, calculator is on.
	  . if 'x48' is blinking, calculator is transfering data.

	- Implemented use of the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF protocol.

	- x48 now uses Xrm...() functions to parse and use
	  Xresources and the command line.

	- Better handling of ButtonPresses and KeyPresses

	- The program now sets the WM_COMMAND property

	- Now colors look well on monochrome and gray

	- A new Colormap is allocated if the standard Colormap is full

	- All possible visuals are supported by the color allocation
	  modell (at least on Linux, I don't really know how to handle
          DirectColor ...)


**********************************************************************

1994/11/02	Version 0.3.4		On the net

	- Real time support mostly works (uses system time)

	- Stores ROM, RAM, and Ports in 'compressed' format

	- tty lines work on HPUX
		Thanks go to Lutz Vieweg (lkv@mania.robin.de)

	- debugger now works on operating systems, where timers interrupt
	  the read system call. 

	- Debugger now uses Class instruction set

	- Disassembler completed (at least hope so)


**********************************************************************

1994/10/06	Version 0.3.3		On the net


	- checkrom, a program to test the ROM CRC included

	- tty lines work on IRIX
		Thanks go to !!!LOOK AT THE MAIL!!!

	- faster X11 interface
		Uses Pixmaps now to update changed nibbles.
		Whenever possible uses XSHM Extension to update
		the display.

	- Start of debugger implementation

	- Disassembler started (HP & Alonzo)

	- SHUTDN bug fixed (didn't wake on received chars)
		Thanks go to Lutz Vieweg (lkv@mania.robin.de)

	- Display bit offset implemented
		

**********************************************************************

1994/10/02	Version 0.3.2		not published

	- Major speed improvement due to scheduling of emulator
	  specific events (timers, adjtime, receive, ...)
		This *really* speeds up the main emulator loop.


**********************************************************************

1994/09/30	Version 0.3.1		not published

	- Added MAGIC number to ~/.hp48/hp48 file

	- Minor optimizations


**********************************************************************

1994/09/18	Second Release		(Version 0.2)

	- Pure X11 interface

	- Start of real time support

	- SHUTDN implemented

	- Keyboard support

	- Compiles better (less warnings) on SunOS, Solaris


**********************************************************************

1994/08/26	Initial Release		(Version 0.1)

	- Emulates the HP48sx fairly

	- Compiles well only on Linux

	- Uses XView Panel and Canvas

	- Must be started in source directory

	- No SHUTDN

	- No real time

	- Misses HP48 keyboard interrupts

	- Slow


**********************************************************************

1994/07		Look at em48 by Paul Fox

	- Starts to run like a HP48


**********************************************************************

1994/05		First Versions

	- No Display at all, merely debugging output


**********************************************************************

1994/04		Fed up with stupid Desktop Calculators
