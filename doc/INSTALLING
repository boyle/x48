INSTALLATION
============

I improved handling of differences in Solaris, SunOS, HP/UX, and Linux.
Things are not perfect, anyway.

To configure some things for the Makefiles, edit 'config.h' in the 
directory 'x48-0.4.0'. There you can set the compiler, flags to
pass to the compiler, and some other stuff.

To build the emulator do the following in the directory 'x48-0.4.0':

  1. xmkmf
  2. make

This should give you the programs 'x48', 'dump2rom', and 'checkrom'
'mkcard' in the directory 'x48-0.4.0/bin'.

To get the serial line working, you should set up your .Xdefaults for
x48. The resources concerning the serial line are:

x48*useSerial:		True
x48*serialLine:		/dev/ttyS0	; your serial device here, this
					; looks good for Linux.

Run 'x48 -help' for a list of command line options.

Look at 'x48-0.4.0/src/X48.ad' for the whole set of Xresources the
program uses.

To use RAM cards (128K or 32K on the SX, up to 4M on the GX), use the
program 'mkcard', and put the resulting file in the directory ~/.hp48/
in a file called 'port1' or 'port2'.
