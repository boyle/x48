TODO -- HP48sx Emulator x48
===========================

Write an MMU. Will increase speed significantly.

Contact Eric Bryntse:
	- ask for description of his Gateway-48 library
	  to trace down the following bug:
            When an alarm wakes up x48, it is not starting
            the exec without being given a password.

Find a way to handle NumLock on those Solaris OpenWindows machines...
(take a look at xterm source)

There should be a menu popping up when the HP Logo in the top left is
hit. It should contain some useful things like

	- RESET BUTTON
	- Configuration (Serial, start kermit automatically, ...)
	- Port configuration (pull card, insert ROM/RAM card, etc.)
	- Pop up a window with debug outputs (speed, cpu usage, PC, ...)
	- The 'About x48' field

!!! Implement an Instruction Cache ... !!! <- SPEED

Speed up register arithmetic.		   +- SPEED

Implement a function "load file (filename)":

	- Read a file starting with "HPHP48-%c"
	- try putting it on the stack as HP Object
	- should not be hard to store it in a variable called 'filename' then

	--> Here we got a fast bypass to the kermit protocol.
