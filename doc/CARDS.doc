Q: How do you dump the Equation Lib?

A: Well, I guess you would have to use some sort of Card copying
   program from the HP48. This should give you an Image of the card.

   You should convert it into an x48 rom-file. Look at dump2rom.c.
   There should be changes for the size of the Card!!!

   Then you should copy this to "$HOME/.hp48/port1" or "$HOME/.hp48/port2".

   Change the file to read only, use 'chmod 444 $HOME/.hp48/port1'.
   The emulator will notice, this is a ROM.

   You are mainly on your own here, I don't have such a card, so I can't
   try, but I hope it helps.
