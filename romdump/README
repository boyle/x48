This is ROMDump, a utility to dump the ROM of ANY HP48
======================================================



Usage:	(2:hxs, 1:hxs --> ) pop start address from level 2,
                            pop end address from level 1, and dump
                            ROM to the serial at 9600 baud using
                            lines of form "aaaaa:hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\r"
                            with 16 nibbles ROM data hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
                            at address aaaaa.



- Download the file ROMDump to your HP.

- To capture a complete ROM, start kermit on your computer,
  set the line so that it fits your HP (use speed == 9600)
  and type 'log session', then 'connect'.

- On your HP48 S/SX type '#0h #7FFF0h ROMDump' or on the G/GX
  '#0h #FFFF0h ROMDump'. This will give you a complete ROM dump.
  This will take about 15 minutes on the S/SX, 30 minutes on the G/GX.

- When done, type the kermit-Escape (usually CTRL-\) followed
  by 'C' on your Computer. Say 'quit' to the kermit.

- Your ROM should now be in the file 'session.log'.



- To dump a certain range of ROM, enter the start-address in hex
  and the end address in hex, and press 'ROMDump'.

  (For example: '#7FFF0h #7FFFFh' ROMDump will output 
   "7FFF0:84054383D21467BC\n\r" on a Version A S/SX.)


I have included the assembler source (class version) for those
interested in fiddling with the hidden ROM...
